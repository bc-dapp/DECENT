# DECENT Network Build Steps

Majority of instructions taken from [DECENTNetwork's GitHub](https://github.com/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network)

Run `install.sh` and it should run all the commands and build. Note that this may take some time. (~30 mins to 1 hour).

It should run the whole thing as well. 

** YOU MUST HAVE Ubuntu 16.04 FOR THIS TO WORK **

# Building for DECENT Private chain

All written instructions are for setting up DECENT Network testnet. This is not the only guide to be followed as I may have missed certain steps. Refer to [Official DECENT Docs](https://github.com/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network/wiki/private-testnet)

## Installation Prerequisites

### For quick installation

** WIP **
Run `prereq.sh` to install prerequisites and set environment variables.

    ./prereq.sh

** WIP **

### Building prerequisites manually

Using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential autotools-dev automake autoconf libtool make cmake checkinstall realpath gcc g++ clang flex bison doxygen gettext git qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev libreadline-dev libcrypto++-dev libgmp-dev libdb-dev libdb++-dev libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-dev libicu-dev libbz2-dev

Set \$CC, \$CXX and add \$CMAKE_ROOT to PATH variable. Check versions of gcc and g++ depending on the OS's version respectively. (using `which` command. Example: `which gcc`)

    $ export CC=gcc-5
    $ export GXX=g++-5

The version of CMAKE in DECENT Network instruction is higher than installed CMAKE version on Ubuntu 16.04. This _may not_ have any effect, but installing it nonetheless. `cmake version 3.5.1` to `cmake version 3.7.2`

    # Download and build CMake 3.7.2
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ rm -rf cmake-3.7.2*
    $ wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ mkdir cmake-3.7.2_prefix
    $ cd cmake-3.7.2
    $ CMAKE_ROOT=$(realpath ../cmake-3.7.2_prefix)
    $ ./configure --prefix=$CMAKE_ROOT
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf cmake-3.7.2 cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ export PATH=$CMAKE_ROOT/bin:$PATH

Boost installation. The boost version that comes with Ubuntu 16.04 is not supported (1.55.0). Decent required 1.60.0

    # Download and build Boost 1.60.0
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ rm -rf boost_1_60_0* boost-1.60.0*
    $ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf boost_1_60_0.tar.gz
    $ mkdir boost-1.60.0_prefix
    $ cd boost_1_60_0
    $ export BOOST_ROOT=$(realpath ../boost-1.60.0_prefix)
    $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$BOOST_ROOT
    $ ./b2 install
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf boost_1_60_0 boost_1_60_0.tar.gz

Building `Boost 1.60.0` may take some time to install.

Errors were encountered because of shell directory variables. Check current variables such as `$BOOST_ROOT`, `$CMAKE_ROOT`, `$CC`, `$CXX`.

## Generating Keys

Within this repo includes a `keys_generator` to generate a public key pair with brain keys for recovery.

Run them and store the output to a file
    
    ./keys_generator > ../account.txt

## Source, Build and Install Decent

The prerequisites must be installed in order for these to work. Again, these instructions are directly taken from DECENT-Network repo with few changes regarding to private net.

    # Clone the repo.
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation
    $ git clone git@github.com:DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network.git
    $ cd DECENT-Network
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

    # Build and install Decent.
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON="$(realpath ../DECENT-Network/genesis/genesis.json)"../DECENT-Network 
    $ cmake --build . --target all -- -j -l 3.0
    $ cmake --build . --target install

# Post Install DECENT

Start the DECENT daemon `decentd` to create a `.decent` folder in the home directory.

    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/
    $ ./decentd

Now press `CTRL-C` to stop `decentd`. This generates `~/.decent` directory. It is now possible to edit the configuration file in `~/.decent/data/decent/config.ini`. Run DECENT Daemon again. (`cd` to the bin folder above and `./decentd`).

Open another terminal and start CLI-Wallet. Make sure `decentd` is running to use `cli_wallet`

    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/
    $ ./cli_wallet

It's going to ask to set the password to initialize. Change `mypassword` into your personal password to set. Only type commands after the `>>>` prompt.
    
    new >>> set_password mypassword
    set_password mypassword
    null
    locked >>> unlock mypassword
    unlock mypassword
    null
    unlocked >>>

When running `cli_wallet` in the future, it will start off as `locked` and using `unlock mypassword` will unlock the commands for `cli_wallet`.

Exit out of the `cli_wallet` and the daemon. Run the following command to activate the decent daemon with additional commands.

    $ ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/decentd --rpc-endpoint 127.0.0.1:8090 --enable-stale-production -w '"1.4.0"' 

Open the wallet after.

# Getting an account

Register at [DecentGo](www.decentgo.com). Generate the private key from Security tab under Account. (Named as Recovery Phrase). **Note:** When dealing with anything that asks for the account name, use the Encrypted Alternate under your wallet.

## Running as GUI

Run the compiled program from wherever the network was built. (Example: ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build) and `cd` to `DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin`. There should be 3 programs there: `decentd` - daemon for decent, `cli_wallet` - command line version of wallet, and `DECENT`, the GUI version. To run the GUI app, execute `./DECENT`

# TODO:

- Finish this documentation
    - Merge `testnetInstall.md` to this `README.md` file
- Create Shell Script file for easy install
    - Install SH
    - Prerequisite SH
    - Boost install check before Decent Install
    - Decent Private Chain setup (including dynamic generation of keys)
        - Key Gen output to file, then to Genesis file, config file


# DECENT Testnet Setup (old way. Must have a compiled copy of decent)


# Generating Keys

Use `program/keys_generator/keys_generator`. The output will be something similar to: (Public Key will have a prefix of DCT)

    Brain key:    FLAKILY OUTGUN RODHAM BEAUX DEWATER BHAVA SONNET ADMIRER TOPH BANKER MISPAGE TELLER JIBBAH UNFINED DOWNCRY MULLID
    Private key:  5JwkqrYHsXtxQwVdi1qQnjodAfPCv2RmHGUPQQhCzFQN6bzhjXv
    Public key:   DCT5jwSywTwSwd3MDfVoDbBKRwaroBBf6mVq7zQJcPaDLZQaiVfTU

Copy these keys and save them somewhere safe (example: ./keysgenerator > ../account.txt)

# Generate Genesis file

Go to where `decentd` was built and open it with flags `--create-genesis-json genesis.json`. Example: 

    programs/decentd/decentd --create-genesis.json genesis.json

The resulting file `genesis.json` should now be generated. Edit it with the keys above.

## Another way...

Copy the `genesis.json` of decent and change the keys. Example:

    cp DECENT-Network/genesis.json genesis.json
    (editor) genesis.json

_Note: (editor) should be your preferred editor like vim, nano, gedit, etc._

Remove the other decent accounts that are different from the majority of the keys. Don't forget to change the name. Along with this file is a sample genesis file. Do not use it as the prefix is different. Looking carefully, there is only 1 key among all the objects. Decent has multiple keys for multiple people.
Also, don't forget to change the `chain_id`

# Creating the config file

Run the following to generate a `config.ini` file for the blockchain.

    artifacts/prefix/bin/decentd --data-dir data/my_block 

The `data` folder should exist. The above command will create a folder named `personal_block` inside `data`.

With your editor of choice, edit `data/my_block/config.ini`. Change the following:

    p2p-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11010
    genesis-json = genesis.json

    private-key = ["YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY", "YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY"]
    miner-id = "1.4.5"

    enable-stale-production=true

The `private-key` variable should be those ones added inside the genesis file.

# Run the testnet

    artifacts/prefix/bin/decentd --data-dir data/my_block --genesis-json genesis.json

At this point, it should all be running fine. If there are no errors, it should start generating blocks after awhile. Scroll up to look for `chain-id`. Copy the value and save it somewhere. It will be used for `CLI_WALLET`

# Using `CLI_WALLET`

Run `cli_wallet` with a provided wallet file (optional) and chain-id derived from running decentd.

    artifacts/prefix/bin/cli_wallet --wallet-file my-wallet.json --chain-id 19b7e44b5d90d7fccfb005f2fd8999d618910b7bd6383e79d9710443640814be
